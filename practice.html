        <p>Media queries allow us to make our sites responsive. We can use media queries to apply CSS styling only when certain conditions apply. For instance, our sites can look different depending on the size of the screen, or viewport a user is viewing our content with. We can also change the way our site appears if a user is printing our website, or using a screen-reader!</p>
